# FileDateTool
File Date Tool is to modify file's created date by reading and using file's modified date. The reason why I created this reposotory is that I found the playlist order in my music player is **disordered** due to the change of file's created date, after I replaed HHD with a new SSD and transfered file from the old to the new.
